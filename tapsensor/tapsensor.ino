// APPLICATIONS 
// USED IN AUTOMATION 
// ENGINE IS UNSTABLE AND VIBRATES VIOLENTLY 
//Repeated knocking causes damage to the cylinder head gasket and cylinder head.
//Knock sensors are used in the carâ€™s spark plug.
//Automotive industries.


//DUE TO VIBRATION A COUNTER WEIGHT INSIDE THE SENSOR IS APPLYING PRESSURE ON THE PIEZO-ELEMENT,
//THIS PRESSURE CREATES AN ELECTRIC CHARGE IN THE PIEZO ELEMENT WHICH IS THE OUTPUT SIGNAL OF THE SENSOR.
